# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repo contains deliverables for the course project.

## Contents
* **run_analysis.R**		R script used to transform the data.  Script contains comments to help user understand the process.  In order to run the script, the data must be in the R root directory such that the following first line of the script will recognize the files properly: # Set home directory homeDir <- "./UCI HAR Dataset".  The script executes a process that performs the following steps in order to create the tidy data file:
1. Download source data to local environment
2. Read files into data frames
3. Combine like files at row level (test and training data)
4. Set friendly names
5. Combine files by adding columns together
6. Order data by subject and variable name
7. Select columns that include mean or std
8. Set friendly activity labels
9. Calculate average of each variable for each activity and each subject
10. Write data to a file
* **AveragedTidyData.txt**	Results of run_analysis.R where data is the final average of each variable for each activity and subject.
* **CodeBook.md**		Description of variables, data and transformations used to clean up the source data.
